# MAX: quantification of mutant-allele expression at isoform level

## 1. What is MAX?
MAX is a novel method to quantify the mutant-allele expression at isoform level from RNA-seq data. 

## 2. The input data of MAX.
MAX requires several files as input. Such as:
- A list of mutations containing the information of chromosome, start position, end position, reference sequence and alternative sequence. Here is an example of the mutation file:
